# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to enhance the existing mock test system by improving the integration with the RAG-based question generation system, adding better analytics, performance optimizations, and enhanced user experience features. The current system already has basic integration with `rag-utils.ts`, but we need to make it more robust, efficient, and feature-rich.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student taking mock tests, I want more detailed performance analytics and insights, so that I can better understand my strengths and weaknesses across different topics and years.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test is completed THEN the system SHALL display topic-wise performance breakdown with specific subtopics
2. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL show year-wise question performance (2020-2025) with trends
3. WHEN reviewing answers THEN the system SHALL provide difficulty-based analysis showing performance across easy/medium/hard questions
4. IF a student has taken multiple tests THEN the system SHALL show progress tracking over time
5. WHEN displaying analytics THEN the system SHALL include time spent per question and identify slow/fast answering patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want better question quality and variety from the RAG system, so that I get more authentic and diverse practice questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating questions THEN the system SHALL ensure no duplicate questions within the same test session
2. WHEN creating a test THEN the system SHALL validate question quality (proper options, explanations, correct answers)
3. WHEN questions are generated THEN the system SHALL include source attribution and confidence scores
4. IF question generation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with different parameters before falling back
5. WHEN displaying questions THEN the system SHALL show question metadata (year, source, difficulty) more prominently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want improved test customization options, so that I can practice specific topics or difficulty levels more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a test THEN the system SHALL allow selection of specific topics within subjects
2. WHEN configuring a test THEN the system SHALL allow custom difficulty distribution (e.g., 30% easy, 50% medium, 20% hard)
3. WHEN creating a custom test THEN the system SHALL allow year range selection (e.g., only 2023-2025 questions)
4. IF creating a focused test THEN the system SHALL allow selection of specific exam patterns or question types
5. WHEN saving test preferences THEN the system SHALL remember user's preferred test configurations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want better performance and reliability during tests, so that I don't experience interruptions or delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a test THEN the system SHALL pre-load questions to avoid delays during the test
2. WHEN generating questions THEN the system SHALL implement caching to avoid regenerating similar question sets
3. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide graceful degradation with meaningful error messages
4. IF network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL work with cached/offline questions
5. WHEN switching between questions THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions without loading delays

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want enhanced review and learning features, so that I can better understand concepts and improve my performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing incorrect answers THEN the system SHALL provide related concept explanations and additional resources
2. WHEN viewing explanations THEN the system SHALL include visual aids, formulas, or diagrams where applicable
3. WHEN completing a test THEN the system SHALL suggest specific topics for further study based on performance
4. IF a student consistently struggles with certain topics THEN the system SHALL recommend targeted practice sessions
5. WHEN reviewing answers THEN the system SHALL allow bookmarking questions for later review
