# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in this Next.js application and provides guidelines for maintaining security.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Environment Variables Security
- ✅ Sensitive API keys moved to environment variables
- ✅ `.env.example` file created for documentation
- ✅ Real API keys removed from version control
- ✅ Environment variable validation added

### 2. Security Headers
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP)
- ✅ X-Frame-Options (Clickjacking protection)
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options (MIME sniffing protection)
- ✅ X-XSS-Protection
- ✅ Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- ✅ Referrer-Policy
- ✅ Permissions-Policy

### 3. Rate Limiting
- ✅ Request rate limiting middleware
- ✅ Different limits for API vs regular routes
- ✅ IP-based rate limiting

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Input sanitization utilities
- ✅ Email validation
- ✅ Password strength validation
- ✅ Request body size limits

### 5. API Security
- ✅ Secure API wrapper with validation
- ✅ Origin validation for state-changing requests
- ✅ Content-Type validation
- ✅ Standardized error responses

### 6. Database Security
- ✅ MongoDB connection security configuration
- ✅ Secure cookie settings
- ✅ Session management

### 7. Build Security
- ✅ Disabled powered-by header
- ✅ React strict mode enabled
- ✅ SVG upload restrictions
- ✅ Image optimization security

## Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Replace all placeholder values in `.env.local`
- [ ] Update domain names in security configurations
- [ ] Run security audit: `npm run security:check`
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Verify CSP headers don't break functionality

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Run `npm audit` weekly
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review security logs
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Review user permissions and access

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables
```bash
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_32_character_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=your_app_url
```

### Optional Variables
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. API Keys Management
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for development and production

### 2. Authentication
- Implement strong password policies
- Use secure session management
- Enable two-factor authentication where possible
- Implement proper logout functionality

### 3. Data Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before processing
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper error handling

### 4. Network Security
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use secure headers
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [security@your-domain.com]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for response before disclosure

## Security Audit

Run the security audit script to check for common issues:

```bash
npm run security:audit
```

This will check for:
- Environment variable security
- Security header configuration
- File permissions
- Code patterns that may introduce vulnerabilities
- Dependency vulnerabilities

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Determine scope of breach
   - Identify root cause
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
   - Implement fixes
   - Restore services
   - Monitor for further issues

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Update security measures
   - Review and improve processes
   - Communicate with users if necessary

## Security Tools

### Recommended Tools
- **npm audit**: Check for dependency vulnerabilities
- **ESLint Security Plugin**: Static code analysis
- **Snyk**: Continuous security monitoring
- **OWASP ZAP**: Web application security testing

### Monitoring
- Set up log monitoring for security events
- Monitor failed authentication attempts
- Track unusual API usage patterns
- Set up alerts for security-related errors

## Compliance

This application implements security measures aligned with:
- OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks
- Next.js Security Best Practices
- MongoDB Security Guidelines
